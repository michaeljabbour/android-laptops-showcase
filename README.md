- **Layout**: Asymmetrical composition with dramatic spacing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS**: No frameworks for maximum performance
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent theming system
- **Intersection Observer**: Efficient scroll-based animations
- **Performance Optimized**: Throttled scroll events, optimized animations
